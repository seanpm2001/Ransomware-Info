| WannaCry 2.0 demanding ransom from its victim |

WannaCry is a 2017 ransomware supposedly made by the North Korean Lazarus Group, this has not been confirmed. The WannaCry ransomware was caused by the WannaCry Worm, which rapidly spread to computers running Microsoft Windows. It was a worldwide cyber attack that wreaked havoc for 4 days. The initial outbreak lasted from 2017 May 12th to 2017 May 15th, but the attack lasted longer than this. A kill switch was discovered just mere hours after the outbreak began, thanks to British security researcher Marcus Hutchins, and prevented already infected computers from being attacked by the ransomware or further spreading the WannaCry worm.

If payment isn't made within the first x hours, the payment required to unlock the files is raised. The amount is continuously raised over 72 hours, before the ransomware just deletes all files.

The spread of the ransomware was made possible by the United States NSA (National Security Agency) because they created the EternalBlue exploit, and it got leaked before they could ever notify Microsoft about the vulnerability (which they likely would never have done anyways)

The ransomware affected all computers running Windows, from Windows XP to Windows 10. It is currently unknown if Windows 11 is vulnerable to WannaCry. MacOS, BSD, and Linux are not affected.

The exploit was so severe that Microsoft made a security update for Windows XP, the famous desktop operating system from 2001 that they had stopped supporting on 2014 April 8th. This was the first update to Windows XP in over 3 years.

The attack was estimated to have affected 200,000 computers from 150 different countries, costing an estimated hundreds of millions to billions of dollars in damage. The ransomware demanded payment in BitCoin.

The 2 developers behind the ransomware were later indicted, but never detained or arrested. The ransomware is still functional on unpatched computers, and it isn't recommended to toy with it on a functional computer, as it may still activate.
