## What is Ransomware

[From Wikipedia: Ransomware (Revision 1105134147)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ransomware&oldid=1105134147)

Ransomware is a type of malware from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's personal data or permanently block access to it unless a ransom is paid. While some simple ransomware may lock the system without damaging any files, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion. It encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. In a properly implemented cryptoviral extortion attack, recovering the files without the decryption key is an intractable problem – and difficult to trace digital currencies such as paysafecard or Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are used for the ransoms, making tracing and prosecuting the perpetrators difficult. 

## General dos and don'ts

1. Back up your files regularly (most important)

> Remember the 3-2-1 rule of data backup

> > The 3-2-1 rule: The idea that a minimal backup solution should include three copies of the data, including two local copies and one remote copy.

> Try to back up at least once per week

2. Don't ever pay the ransom

> This just allows for more ransomware to be created, there is also a chance your files may have just been renamed, or that the ransomware developers won’t decrypt your files, and will laugh at your face as they steal your money and destroy your files.

3. Do not attempt to access your backups or perform a backup until the ransomware is fully removed

> Do not attempt to access your backups or try to back up data until the ransomware is fully removed, or if the external device you are plugging in is empty, and is low risk. Doing so may result in your backups on your external device to also be infected and destroyed

4. Use a secure operating system

> Keep your system up to date, security updates are crucial

> Consider switching from Windows outside of a virtual machine, since the majority of ransomware affects Windows, and Windows is vulnerable to drive-by-attacks (simply visiting a webpage and not clicking anything is enough for malware to get installed onto your computer) and network ransomware (if one device in your household gets ransomware, it can spread to other computers via the network (Wi-Fi) )

## Not all may be lost

Some ransomware sets only rename files. Once you remove the ransomware, there is a chance that simply renaming the file with its original extension will recover it, without even having to pay ransom.

## Psychology

Ransomware relies on social engineering and psychological attacks to use against its victims. Social engineering and related attacks are typically used in the process of getting the ransomware to be installed by a user.

## Ethical ransomware

If you are thinking of developing ransomware, please at the very least include a script that can deactivate the ransomware if there is no way to access the ransom payment method (eg: servers down forever)

[Scripts for automatic de-activation](/Scripts/De-activate/)

Ransomware generally is never ethical.
