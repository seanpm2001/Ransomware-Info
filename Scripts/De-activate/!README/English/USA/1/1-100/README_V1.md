# A guide to more ethical ransomware

## Scripts / De-activation

### About

If you are developing ransomware, you should include a script to de-activate the ransomware if the server is down forever, so that it doesn't do completely unnecessary harm. Scripts for this purpose have been made pre-ready. Take the extra minute to add them to your ransomware.

[`Look for scripts by language`](/Scripts/De-activate/ByLanguage/)

> [`Microsoft C#`](/Scripts/De-activate/ByLanguage/C%23/DE-ACTIVATE.cs)

Remember: professionals have standards. Also, please reconsider writing ransomware if possible. If not, don't be purely evil.
